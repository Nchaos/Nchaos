Netflix - Probably the most well-deisgned out of all the sites. It is easy to learn, and viewing media is deilightful. It is fairly efficient and effective to view what you want to view. Very useful because it has something for everyone to watch. Unique design is memorable

HuluPlus - Easy to learn website but not desirable or delightful. Viewing videos requires frequent ads throughout the video and is very annoying. Useful because you can watch SOME current TV shows but other than that the other sites are more appealing. Not super memorable. 

Youtube - Well-deisgned, easy to learn, but viewing the media is not as delightful as Netflix. Useful to watch random videos. Unique memorable site. Efficient and Effective for finding what you want to watch and viewing it fast.
